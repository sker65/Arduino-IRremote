This is the IRremote library originally for the Arduino.

I've done a port for the PIC32 processor family used by various boards.

To download from github (http://github.com/sker65/Arduino-IRremote), 
click on the "Downloads" link in the upper right, click "Download as zip", and get a zip file.  Unzip it and rename the directory shirriff-Arduino-IRremote-nnn to IRremote

To install, move the downloaded IRremote directory to:
arduino-1.x/libraries/IRremote
where arduino-1.x is your Arduino installation directory

For PIC boards it depends on the IDE you are using.

After installation you should have files such as:
arduino-1.x/libraries/IRremote/IRremote.cpp

For details on the library see the Wiki on github or the blog post http://arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html
